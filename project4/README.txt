2. I think it will take me 30 hours
3. 50
4. There were some tough methods such as normalizeBigNum() and arrayInitialize() that took a really long time for me to figure out.
5. I liked this assignment because it was fun. It was basically like solving a bunch of puzzles.
6. My only suggestion would be to add a portion to the FAQ sheet stating how we are supposed to handle a linked list with one value that is equal to 0 in the normalizeBigNum() method. My code deletes that value, as it is by definition a leading 0, but 0 is an actual number, and deleting it would take away its value.
